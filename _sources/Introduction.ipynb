    "1. Write out on paper the algorithm, data structures\n",

A keystone idea in modern scientific programming is that you are not trying to adjust your thinking so that you can talk to the computer -- rather you are trying to make the computer understand your language, so that you can effortlessly talk to the computer.\n"
