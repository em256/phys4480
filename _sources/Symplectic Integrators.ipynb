    "To understand the conservation of phase space volume, lets begin with a 1-dimensional case, where $x$ and $p$ are scalars.  In that case imagine the small triangle in phase space, with corners $(x_1,p_1)=(x,p)$, $(x_2,p_2)=(x+dx,p)$, $(x_3,p_3)=(x,p+dp)$.  That patch of phase space has area $A=dx\\times dp/2$.  If we define $\\vec{R}=(x,p)$, then that area can also be written as a cross product, ie $A=|(\\vec{R_3}-\\vec{R_1})\\times(\\vec{R_2}-\\vec{R_1})|/2$.  Liouville's theorem states that the area of that triangle is preserved under time evolution.  Any geometric shape can be made by piecing together triangles -- so any phase space volume is preserved.  Moreover, when generalized to higher dimensions the same feature persists.  The hypervolume of any geometric shape is preserved.\n",
