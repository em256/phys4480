    "The course will be assessed pass-fail.   This is an relatively new curriculum, so I am still figuring out how much time needs to be devoted to the various elements of the course.  At this point I am not able to give a full map of the activities and their due dates.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Nonetheless, here is my rough set of required activities:\n",
    "- Module 1: Quadrature\n",
    "    - Lab -- Period of a Pendulum\n",
    "    - HW 1\n",
    "- Module 2: Ordinary Differential Equations\n",
    "    - Lab - Projectile Motion\n",
    "    - HW 2\n",
    "- Module 3: Classical Mechanics\n",
    "    - Lab - Chaos\n",
    "    - HW 3\n",
    "    - LAB - Animating the Duffing Oscillator\n",
    "- Module 4: Dynamical Systems\n",
    "    - Lab - Kinetic Theory\n",
    "    - HW 4\n",
    "- Module 5: Stochastic Methods\n",
    "    - Lab - Ising Model\n",
    "    - HW 5\n",

    "\n",
    "Regardless -- you should expect to have some assigned activity every week, either a lab or a homework.  We will spend some class time on the labs -- as having some help will be useful.  I'll probably also try to do some \"pair programming\" activities.\n",
    "\n",
    "You should budget 3-4 hours to complete the assigned activities in addition to the 3-hours per week of class time.  If you add some reading/thinking time that will take us up to the state mandated 9 hours per week of work for a 3 credit course. Students taking the course as PHYS 7680 or ASTRO 7690 will have an additional project that they will need to complete.  There are no exams.\n",
    "\n",

You can either use the notebook (like I do for my lectures) or powerpoint.  I am not going to mandate a length/time requirement -- but please try to keep it concise.  It is better to have it short and leaving people wanting more than it is to make it long and put people to sleep.  If you are needing more than 10 minutes, then you are probably giving more details than anyone in the class wants.\n",
