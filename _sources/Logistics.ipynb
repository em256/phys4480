    "The course will be assessed pass-fail.   This is an entirely new curriculum, so I am still figuring out how much time needs to be devoted to the various elements of the course.  At this point I am not able to give a full map of the activities and their due dates.  You should expect to have some assigned activity every week, and should budget 3-4 hours to complete it, in addition to the 3-hours per week of class time.  If you add some reading/thinking time that will take us up to the state mandated 9 hours per week of work for a 3 credit course. Students taking the course as PHYS 7680 or ASTRO 7690 will have an additional project that they will need to complete.  There are no exams."
